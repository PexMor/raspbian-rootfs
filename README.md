# Raspbian rootfs

A tool to build Raspbian a Raspberry Pi Debian root filesystem.

Inspired by a dozen other repositories intended to build rootfs usable for cross platform builds.
Mainly for x86 to armhf (Raspberry Pi) builds.

## Docker repos:

* [skarbat/sdl2-raspberrypi](https://github.com/skarbat/sdl2-raspberrypi)
* [schachr/docker-raspbian-stretch](https://github.com/schachr/docker-raspbian-stretch)
* [dockcross/dockcross](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross)
* [sdt/docker-raspberry-pi-cross-compiler](https://github.com/sdt/docker-raspberry-pi-cross-compiler)

## To do...

* make automation to upload rootfs upon upstream change (partly done)
* incorporate customization for target use-cases (docker, cross-build, any other?)
